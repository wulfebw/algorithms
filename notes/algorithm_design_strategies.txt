incremental
---
- e.g., insertion sort
- incrementally change parts of the input data, thereby separating it into two compoenents
- first is the componenet of the data that is in the desired form, second is the component that's not

divide-and-conquer
---
- steps 
    1. divide problem into smaller instances of the same problem
    2. conquer problem by continuing to divide, unless sufficiently small then just solve
    3. combine solutions to subproblems
- e.g., merge sort
