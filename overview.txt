- algorithms
    - 
- concepts
    - big theta
    - big O
    - big Omega
    - little o
    - little omega
    - limits (e.g., lhopitals) (for comparing functions you're not sure about e.g., logn vs sqrt(n))
    - different ways of establishing these bounds
        - proof from definition
            - literally finding constants c1, c2, n0 such that the definitions hold
        - lim -> inf
        - proof of theta from bigO and bigOmega
    - stirlings formula for factorials
    - asymptotic notions
    - monotinicity
    - floor and ceiling
    - mod
    - polynomials
    - exp
    - log
        - not that all the log bases are in the same bigTheta
    - factorials
    - iterated factorial
    - iterated log
    - fib
