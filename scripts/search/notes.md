# types of search problems
1. linear search 
    - linearly move through the data with possible fancy additions
    - examples:
        + radio_transmitters.py
    - with sorting to allow for breaking early:
        + house_prices
            * by sorting you can infer information while iterating
2. binary search 
    - typically involves sorted values that are implicitly discarded
    - binary search tree search
3. graph search
    - knight_walk and multi_knight_walk
    - using bfs or dfs as a subroutine
