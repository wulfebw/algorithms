'''
This is one of those problems where the obvious recursive solution is in 
terms of the possible values that you can use, or rather, is a non linear 
function of the number of those values, whereas the iterative solution is 
a linear function of them

At least I thought that was the case, but when you run these, their runtime 
is about the same?
Ok, it's more nuanced
- the recursive solution runtime depends heavily on the problem, which is 
typically undesireable, and in the worst case might be exponential in m?

    The way this works is it says, for each possible sum you could encounter
    that sum is true (i.e., can be achieved) if either of two things is true
    1. that from that sum, you ignore one of the possible set values and continue on 
    2. that you subtract that set value and continue on
    so you're answering the question, do we _ever_ use this value in the set?
