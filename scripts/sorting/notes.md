# sorting algorithms
1. comparison sorting algorithms 
    - merge sort
    - quick sort 
    - heap sort
    - insertion sort
    - selection sort
2. linear time sorting algorithms 
    - counting sort 
    - bucket sort 
    - radix sort 

# types of sorting problems
1. implementation
    - implement one of the above algorithms
    - describe adv and disadv of each of them 
    - give analysis
2. problems where sorting the input is a subroutine
    - fraud_detection
        + in particular this is a case where counting sort applies
    - swaps_to_sort
        + what's the minimum number of swaps needed to sort an array? 
    - find triplets that sum to 0

# lessons
- for problems you really need to look at the values of the inputs and see if you can take advantage of them in some way
